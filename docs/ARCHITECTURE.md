## Recent Improvements (v2.0)

### ðŸ§¹ Codebase Cleanup
As part of the recent optimization effort, the following improvements were made:

#### Removed Components
- **Legacy Scripts**: Removed redundant scripts from `scripts/` directory
- **Duplicate Templates**: Consolidated `index.html` and kept `index_new.html` as the main template
- **Redundant JavaScript**: Merged `ui.js` functionality into `upload.js`
- **Debug Code**: Removed 20+ console.log statements for production optimization
- **Empty Files**: Cleaned up placeholder files and documentation

#### Enhanced Components
- **Modern Web UI**: Tabbed modal interface with drag & drop functionality
- **Live Testing**: Integrated endpoint testing within the web interface
- **Session Management**: UUID-based session handling for multi-user support
- **WireMock Integration**: Real-time health monitoring and admin access
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS

#### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Consolidated JavaScript files (~1,400 lines removed)
- **Optimized Loading**: Removed unnecessary console logging
- **Clean Architecture**: Improved separation of concerns
- **Docker Optimization**: Updated to WireMock 3.13.1 with better performance

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Application Factory Pattern
The web application uses Flask's application factory pattern for better testability and configuration management.

```python
# src/web/app.py
def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # Configuration
    # Blueprint registration
    return app
```

### 2. Blueprint Organization
Routes are organized into logical blueprints:
- `main_routes`: Main pages and health checks
- `api_routes`: REST API endpoints

### 3. Service Layer
Business logic is separated into service classes:
- `FileService`: File operations
- `GenerationService`: Mapping generation

### 4. Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Core**: Pure business logic, no dependencies on web or CLI
- **CLI**: Command-line interface, imports from core
- **Web**: Web interface, imports from core through services

## Entry Points

### CLI Entry Point (`wiremock-generator`)
```bash
# Direct execution
./wiremock-generator --spec-dir ./examples --output-dir ./output

# With options
./wiremock-generator --spec-dir ./examples --output-dir ./output --include-java --verbose
```

### Web Entry Point (`wiremock-web`)
```bash
# Start web server
./wiremock-web

# Available at http://localhost:5001
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
The application supports configuration through environment variables:
- `FLASK_ENV`: Development/production mode
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Custom upload directory
- `TEMP_FOLDER`: Custom temporary directory

### Application Configuration
```python
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024  # 16MB
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = './src/web/uploads'
app.config['TEMP_FOLDER'] = './src/web/temp'
```

## Import Strategy

### Core Imports
```python
from src.core.multi_spec_wiremock_generator import MultiSpecWireMockGenerator
```

### Web Service Imports
```python
from src.web.services.file_service import FileService
from src.web.services.generation_service import GenerationService
```

### Route Imports
```python
from src.web.routes.main_routes import create_main_blueprint
from src.web.routes.api_routes import create_api_blueprint
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup
```bash
make setup          # Install dependencies and setup
```

### 2. Development
```bash
make dev-setup      # Setup development environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Optional: activate virtual environment
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
make test           # Run all tests
```

### 4. Local Development
```bash
make web-dev        # Start web UI locally
./wiremock-generator --help  # Test CLI
```

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
./wiremock-web      # Direct Python execution
```

### Docker Development
```bash
make web-ui         # Docker-based web UI
```

### Production
```bash
docker-compose up -d  # Full stack deployment
```

## Security Considerations

### File Upload Security
- Filename sanitization with `secure_filename()`
- File type validation (YAML/JSON only)
- Size limits (16MB maximum)
- Session-based isolation

### Session Management
- UUID-based session IDs
- Automatic cleanup after 1 hour
- Isolated temporary directories per session

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data)
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Performance Considerations

### File Handling
- Streaming file uploads for large files
- Efficient ZIP creation for downloads
- Background cleanup of old sessions

### Memory Management
- Session-based temporary storage
- Automatic cleanup mechanisms
- Configurable upload limits

### Scalability
- Stateless application design
- External storage ready (S3, etc.)
- Horizontal scaling support

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks
```
GET /health
```
Returns service status and version information.

### Logging
- Structured logging for debugging
- Error tracking for production monitoring
- Performance metrics collection ready

### Metrics
- Session creation/cleanup statistics
- Generation success/failure rates
- Response time tracking

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
1. Keep core logic framework-agnostic
2. Use dependency injection for services
3. Separate business logic from presentation
4. Maintain clear import hierarchies

### Testing
1. Unit tests for core logic
2. Integration tests for services
3. End-to-end tests for web flows
4. Fixture-based test data

### Documentation
1. Inline code documentation
2. API documentation for web endpoints
3. Usage examples in README
4. Architecture decision records

### Security
1. Input validation at all entry points
2. Secure file handling practices
3. Regular dependency updates
4. Security-focused code reviews

This structure provides a solid foundation for continued development and maintenance of the WireMock Mapping Generator project.
