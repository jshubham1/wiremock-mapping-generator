# 🔄 Git Repository Initialization Guide

## ✅ Git History Cleanup Complete

All Git references have been successfully removed from this codebase:
- ✅ `.git` directory removed (all history and configuration)
- ✅ Old `.gitignore` removed and replaced with clean version
- ✅ `.gitkeep` files recreated for directory structure
- ✅ No repository references found in configuration files

## 🚀 Initialize New Private Repository

### Step 1: Create a new private repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Set repository name (e.g., `wiremock-mapping-generator-private`)
3. **Set to Private** ⚠️
4. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have our own)

### Step 2: Initialize Git in this directory
```bash
cd /Users/shubhamjain/Documents/ABN/wiremock-poc/wiremock-mapping-generator

# Initialize new Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Enhanced WireMock OpenAPI Mapping Generator

Features:
- Comprehensive mapping generation for 8 HTTP status codes
- Spec-compliant response bodies from OpenAPI specification  
- Smart request matching with priority-based routing
- 56 mappings and 48 response files generated
- Enhanced testing and documentation"

# Add your new private repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Replace repository information
Update the following command with your actual repository details:
```bash
# Example:
git remote add origin https://github.com/jshubham1/wiremock-mapping-generator-private.git
```

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### Files Currently Excluded from Git:
- `wiremock/mappings/*.json` - Generated mapping files
- `wiremock/__files/*.json` - Generated response files  
- `.env.production` and `.env.secrets` - Sensitive environment files
- Various temporary and system files

### ⚠️ Before Committing:
1. **Review all files** for any remaining confidential information
2. **Check environment files** (.env, .env.enhanced) for sensitive data
3. **Verify OpenAPI spec** doesn't contain internal URLs or credentials
4. **Set repository to Private** on GitHub

### 🔍 Security Checklist:
- [ ] New repository set to **Private**
- [ ] All confidential data removed from files
- [ ] Environment variables reviewed
- [ ] Internal URLs/IPs replaced with examples
- [ ] API keys or tokens removed
- [ ] Network configurations sanitized
